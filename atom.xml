    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>BEGIN<br>Hi, I’m 刘印全, majoring in Software Engineering of Chong Qing University of Posts and Telecommunications.<br>Today I will talk about the power of self-discipline in our life. Self-discipline is one of the most important and useful skills everyone should possess. In my opinion, self-discipline is the power to achieve goals.<br>Here is my personal experience.<br>During the period of preparing for cet-6, when I was bored, I would open English reading app instead of opening the game. At the begging, I was dying to play a game. However, I gradually found that reading is more interesting than playing games.<br>As I prepare the Graduate exam, I got up at six, went to bed at eleven, study for twelve hours. But everyone has his slack days. Especially in winter, it is very cold. When I close the alarm clock and going back to sleep, but self-discipline wake me up. In preparation for the exam, self-discipline help me a lot.  </p><hr><p>BODY<br>Now, I want to talk about why self-discipline is the power to accomplish goals.<br>First，Self-discipline gives us constant motivation. We need motivation in everything we do，but when we do a job over and over again, the motivation will fade away slowly，and finally give up. But Self-discipline urges us to finish our work.<br>Second，self-discipline makes us confident. Because self-discipline makes us have many good habits. When you face a new difficulty, you believe that you can solve it by working hard.<br>Last but not least, self-discipline gives you the power to stick to your decisions and follow them through, without changing your mind, and is therefore, one of the important requirements for achieving goals.</p><hr><p>CONCLUSION<br>To sum up, the possession of self-discipline enables you to persevere with your decisions and plans how to accomplish your goals. It also strengthen your mind, helping you to overcome addictions, procrastination and laziness, and to follow through with whatever you do.</p><p>Thank you for listening.</p><p>自律可以从小事做起，例如坚持每天早上起来叠被子，形成习惯，</p>]]></content>
